I wish to create a floating city in space, with beautiful colours and a variety of triggers.
I want to add subtle but noticable animations and suitable ambient sounds. All to be 
explored by a free roaming first person controller. Ultimately the buildings will be enterable 
to explore. Recently I've been very in to space movies such as Interstellar, so they would
be my main source of inspiration. I want the game to feel quite real in terms of the physics
so work will have to be done to achieve that.

In order to reach my final goal I will need to use a variety of scripts and objects, I will
begin by creating different building prefabs to be spawned within the world in random locations
when the application begins, giving it a fresh feel with every play. I will use the animator 
provided within unity to animate these buildings. I will include triggers with the player to make
some interesting events occur as you explore. Music will also be an important choice I have to make.
I anticipate that I will lokk at my past projects in order to help me along with this one. I will 
also use the project used within our class to assist this creation.
