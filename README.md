I wish to create a floating city in space, with beautiful colours and a variety of triggers.
I want to add subtle but noticable animations and suitable ambient sounds. All to be 
explored by a free roaming first person controller. Ultimately the buildings will be enterable 
to explore. Recently I've been very in to space movies such as Interstellar, so they would
be my main source of inspiration. I want the game to feel quite real in terms of the physics
so work will have to be done to achieve that.

In order to reach my final goal I will need to use a variety of scripts and objects, I will
begin by creating different building prefabs to be spawned within the world in random locations
when the application begins, giving it a fresh feel with every play. I will use the animator 
provided within unity to animate these buildings. I will include triggers with the player to make
some interesting events occur as you explore. Music will also be an important choice I have to make.
I anticipate that I will lokk at my past projects in order to help me along with this one. I will 
also use the project used within our class to assist this creation.

Description -
'Galactic Disruption' is a programme in which the player flies around an open space, intended to be outer
space. They can choose if they wish to just explore or destroy all the planets they want with their ability 
to fire 'planet destroyers'. When a planet is destroyed it will explode, destroying any planets close by. This
was achieved mostly by the triggers available within Unity, collision detections and such.
I made sure that the player will never get lost as in the case that they wander too far a new set of planets
will spawn around them. I used suitable and immersive audio so this is best experienced with headphones. I
also made good use of the particle systems provided by Unity to create a more atmospheric environment, making the 
player feel as if they are travelling at extremely high speeds, which they are to be honest. With the spawn system 
I created all planets are different in every aspect, including size and color. They rotate and gain or lose altitude
depending on their position.(SOUND WARNING) - I advise you start with low sound and adjust from there because some of the audio may
be too loud, sorry.

Most of the code I done completely independently but not all, I went and looked at the coroutine on the tank which was 
created in class and used it in a similar way, to set the rate of fire of the powerful weaponary in the programme. I also 
had to use a YouTube video for help, in order to allow each individual planet to spawn with a different color, mostly it was 
all me though.

Looking at it now, I am most proud of the script used to spawn the planets. I think I made great use of the randomisation 
in order to create a unique experience with each play. I am also proud of the audio choices, I feel I picked very suitable sounds.
